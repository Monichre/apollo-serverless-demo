# fanout.io lambda/apollo demo

An example of how to use AWS Lambda with fanout.io.

The specific AWS resources required are encoded in this source code repository using TypeScript and objects from the [@pulumi](https://pulumi.io/quickstart/) npm modules. This is a pattern called [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), and is useful because it lets us apply the same software development methodologies and change controls to our cloud resources as we do to our application source code.

## Usage

You'll need an AWS Account. This repository will depend on the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable being set.
This value should correspond to an entry in your `~/.aws/credentials` file, from which AWS SDKs will pull your account's access key and secret.
For more on all this, see [AWS User Guide - Named Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).

The following steps illustrate how to apply the configuration in this repository to 'the cloud'. If you encounter any issues in your development environment, please file an issue at https://github.com/fanout/apollo-demo.

1. Ensure you have proper AWS credentials for our AWS accounts, add them to an aws-cli named profile, and ensure the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set to the profile you want to use

  ```
  export AWS_PROFILE=you@fanout.io
  ```

2. Install pulumi following instructions at https://pulumi.io/quickstart/

3. Clone this repository and `cd` into the top-level directory

4. `npm install`

5. `pulumi up` and follow the CLI instructions.
